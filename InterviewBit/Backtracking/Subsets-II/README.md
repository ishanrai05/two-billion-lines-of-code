Given a collection of integers that might contain duplicates, S, return all possible subsets.

 Note:
1. Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.
2. The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
3. The subsets must be sorted lexicographically.

**Example :**

If S = [1,2,2], the solution is:
```
[
[],
[1],
[1,2],
[1,2,2],
[2],
[2, 2]
]
```
