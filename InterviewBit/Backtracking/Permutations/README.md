Given a collection of numbers, return all possible permutations.

**Example:**
```
[1,2,3] will have the following permutations:

[1,2,3]
[1,3,2]
[2,1,3] 
[2,3,1] 
[3,1,2] 
[3,2,1]
```

**NOTE**
1. No two entries in the permutation sequence should be the same.
2. For the purpose of this problem, assume that all the numbers in the collection are unique.
